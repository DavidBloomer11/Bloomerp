"""Celery autodiscovery entrypoint for Bloomerp tasks.

Celery commonly autodiscovers ``<app>.tasks`` modules for each installed app.
The actual task implementations live in submodules, so importing them here ensures
their ``@shared_task`` declarations are registered when a worker or beat process
starts.
