# Introducing BloomAI

BloomAI is an exciting new feature that is being explored. 
The goal was to integrate the power of LLMs within the Bloomerp environment to extend beyond basic text generation.

We believe we have reached this goal by providing the following features:
- **BloomAI assistant**: The most exciting feature is the BloomAI assistant that can answer your queries by having access to the tables that a particular has access to.
- **Generating SQL Queries**: BloomAI gives you the ability to create SQL queries, making querying important company data easier than ever. It works by having access to all of the tables and fields in the database, and is highly effective in most cases.
- **Generating document templates**: BloomAI can help you create Document Templates as it has access to the model variables that is linked to the document template.
- **Integration in text editor**: When using a Bloomerp Text Editor (which can be defined as a model field), it has BloomAI integrated into it to facilitate the generation of content.

## BloomAI Assistant
As stated before, the BloomAI assistant is a very promising feature that can make managing your business a lot easier. To start, simply click on the AI button in the nav bar (in the header of each page). That will launch a modal in which you can converse with the assistant. The assistant has access to the database tables that the user who uses the assistant has access to, shielding leakage of unwanted data to unauthorized users.

## Generating SQL Queries
In order to use BloomAI to generate SQL Queries, first navigate to the `Create SQL Query` page. Once there, you can click on the magic wand which will show a modal in which you can query in natural language what you want.
